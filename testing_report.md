# Amplify Frontend Testing Report

## Backend API Testing Results

The backend API tests were successful. All endpoints are functioning correctly:

- ✅ Health check endpoint (/api/health) returns proper status
- ✅ Creator registration endpoint (/api/register) works correctly
- ✅ Creator lookup by channel ID and wallet address works
- ✅ Tip recording functionality works
- ✅ Channel statistics endpoint returns correct data

## Frontend Testing Results

The frontend has a critical issue that prevents it from functioning properly:

### Critical Issues:

1. **Missing Node.js Core Module Polyfills**:
   - Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in '@toruslabs/eccrypto/dist'
   - Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'cipher-base'

   These errors occur because webpack 5 (used by React) no longer includes polyfills for Node.js core modules by default. This affects the Solana wallet integration, which depends on these modules.

2. **UI Rendering Issues**:
   - The app loads with compilation errors visible to users
   - The wallet connection functionality is likely broken due to these errors

### Recommended Fixes:

1. **Add Node.js Polyfills**:
   - Install required packages:
     ```
     yarn add crypto-browserify stream-browserify buffer process
     ```
   
   - Create a `craco.config.js` file to override webpack configuration:
     ```javascript
     const webpack = require('webpack');

     module.exports = {
       webpack: {
         configure: {
           resolve: {
             fallback: {
               crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
               stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
               buffer: require.resolve('buffer/'),
               process: require.resolve('process/browser'),
             },
           },
         },
         plugins: {
           add: [
             new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
               Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer'],
               process: 'process/browser',
             }),
           ],
         },
       },
     };
     ```

   - Update package.json to use CRACO:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       // existing dependencies
       "crypto-browserify": "^3.12.0",
       "stream-browserify": "^3.0.0",
       "buffer": "^6.0.3",
       "process": "^0.11.10",
       "@craco/craco": "^7.1.0"
     },
     "scripts": {
       "start": "craco start",
       "build": "craco build",
       "test": "craco test"
     }
     ```

## Testing Limitations

1. **Wallet Integration**: Unable to fully test the Phantom wallet integration as it requires the browser extension.
2. **Solana Transactions**: Unable to test actual USDC transactions on the Solana Devnet.

## Conclusion

The backend API is fully functional and ready for use. However, the frontend has critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be properly tested and used. The main issue is related to missing Node.js core module polyfills in webpack 5, which affects the Solana wallet integration.

Once these issues are fixed, further testing should be conducted to verify the wallet connection and transaction functionality.
